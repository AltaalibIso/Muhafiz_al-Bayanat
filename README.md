# Muhafiz al-Bayanat (محافظ البيانات)

## Global Objective
The primary goal of this project is to provide robust data protection mechanisms, facilitating automatic, scheduled, and scenario-based backups to cloud storage. This ensures data safety and accessibility at all times.

## Tasks
1. **Automatic, Scheduled, and Scenario-Based Data Backup to Cloud:**
   - Backup initiation upon device startup.
   - Backup initiation upon device shutdown, even in unexpected scenarios.
   
2. **Data Synchronization Across Different Devices:**
   - Synchronize data seamlessly across multiple devices to ensure consistency and accessibility.
   
3. **Display Data Status:**
   - Provide users with a clear and intuitive interface to monitor the status of their data, including backup progress, synchronization status, and any potential issues.

## Technologies
- Cloud storage integration (e.g., AWS S3, Google Drive, Dropbox)
- Cross-platform synchronization protocols (e.g., SyncThing, rsync)
- User-friendly interface for data status visualization
